Writing the HTML and CSS from scratch to create the CSS Snippet Cheatsheet web application.

The following was completed for the application:

* a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

* CSS snippets recognizable by their headings.

* a code snippet highlights by clicking on it.

* the application is responsive for viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile device

* uses semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.

* Uses CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

* Uses flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

* Each CSS snippet has a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in a pre element

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click 

* has a background color using a linear gradient

* uses a bit of animation using transitions
